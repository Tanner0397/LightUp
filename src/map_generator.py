"""
Parameters: None
Return: None
Update map function. The purpose of this function is create a list of all the tiles that are bulbs, remove the bulbs
and then place the bulbs back to their original spot. This is so that when generating the puzzle and a wall is placed, the bulb
will not shine through the wall

    for panel in bulb_panels:
        #update the panels. panel[0]is the row and panel[1] is the col

"""
Parameters: None
Return: Light_puzzle Object
Generate map function. This function will generate a map that is guarteed to be solvable since the function exist when the map has no white cells left,
bulbs are only placed on cells that are unlit so no bulbs shine on each other. The wall values are only placed once the map is full, and the value is placed
depending on the bumber of bulbs adjacent to it after the map is filled.

Note: Due to how this program generates puzzles, all puzzle generated within a partiular experiment will have the same number of wall panels
since the config file used a percentage of what cells should walls.
