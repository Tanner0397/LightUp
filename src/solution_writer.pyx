Paramters: (puzzle) where puzzle is a Light_puzzle object
Return: None
This function simply take a puzzle passes to it and generates the solution file as specified. The first entry is an integer that represents the number of columns
, and the second entry is an integer that represents the number of rows. The next rows tell locations of black cells (walls) and are in the format
 <col> <row> <value> where col and row and indexed at 1 and start from the bottom lefthand corner of the map. When the walls are done being listed
 the next entry is a single integer that is the fitness value of the the current puzzle passes. After the fitness value the rest of the
 file consist locations of bulbs in the map in <col> <row> formatting with and indexing scheme identical to how walls are represented
